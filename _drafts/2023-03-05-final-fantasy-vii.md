It would be many cold winters without a new hit from Squaresoft. Fans, starving in the streets for a new entry in the franchise. Chaos would errupt! Countries would go to war! Also a new generation of consoles would be released, which could explain the wait. But in actually, it wasn't too long. A mere 3 years later and the end of janaury brought japanese audiences a new treat—**Final Fantasy VII**. While winter of 1997 would be fun for Japan, it would be autumn of that same year when the U.S. would recieve this game. When it came out, I had only played *Final Fantasy IV*, [and as you may remember]({% post_url 2021-03-04-final-fantasy-iv %}), it had a bad battery. And I also knew it as *Final Fantasy II*. Now suddenly I was looking at a game 5 games later and was completely baffled. The trailer made it look cool. It was on a console I didn't have. Needless to say, my envy was high. There have been may versions of the game, some remakes as well. For this review, I played the Switch port which—after some extensive research—I still can't confirm which version of the game was ported to Switch.

> An energy manufacturing mega-company known as Shinra, Inc. is harvesting the sheer life energy of the Planet (known as the Lifestream) as a simple fossil fuel. The Lifestream is processed and made into products ranging from electricity and heat to Mako and Materia. The latter two materials can work miracles, granting the wisdom of the Ancients to the user. However, the Lifestream, like most other fuels, is finite in supply, and the Planet's lifeforce is being malevolently drained by the constant exploitation of Mako by Shinra. Though aware of the harmful effects, they function without remorse.

Final Fantasy VII is arguably the most famous of the Final Fantasy titles. Likely only overshadowed by Final Fantasy XIV, but that is in its own bucket. A point could be made that it recieving a complete (and orignally titled) remake recently could lend to its popularity. But it also being the only game in the franchise to recieve a full-blown remake and not a graphical and technical update, it is safe assume msot popular. The biggest question is why? For starters we have a much more intimate cast than our last game, cutting down the massive team from 14 to nine. And while Final Fantasy VI had its share of random characters joining along for non-existent reasons (looking at you Umaro and Gogo), Final Fantasy VII instead focuses on having everyone join with intention and motivation. Even the two characters you could theoretically never recruit if you opt not to.

An early downside we find is that the only differentiation between characters is their basic stats and their unqiue Limit Breaks. Much more accesible than Desperation Attacks in Final Fantasy VI, Limit Breaks have a meter which fills befor eletting you unleash an attack of your choosing. Each character has seven different options, gained as you make kills, use Limit Breaks and in the case of their Level 4 and strongest option, find some fancy item.

This time around we have a few fun options for gearing up our party to beat down some monsters. Equipment has been reduced down to a single weapon and piece of armor. Both sporting Materia slots in growing numbers as the game progresses. We also have Accessories again. Keeping in trend from Final Fantasy VI is the fact that accessories have been made unique and useful and not just rising degrees of miscelaneous stat buffing items.

But lets rewind, I mentioend Materia, and Materia Slots earlier? What is that all about? Well this is one of the more siganture aspects of Final Fantasy VII—Materia. Materia are equippable items that come in five flavors—Magic, Support, Command, Summon, and Independant—and are equivalent to the customization options of the past games. By equipping Magic, Command, and Summon Materia you gain access to spells or unique commands. Support Materia works in conjuction with those three flavors of Materia in order to change how they work, or how often they can be used. And lastly is Independant Materia which does its own thing, and can provide classic benefits such as counter attacking, or passive increases to HP or MP. The slots you have is determined by your equipment, so as the game progresses you gain more slots to play with. This is kind of odd when consider it. While stats may be tied to levels, buying new equipment does just as much if not more. This is a trend we will see more of in this third trilogy of games.

#### Expectations

This game has been hyped up so much. It is the single most hyped up game so far. My previous experience was minimal. I remember the Midgar section well, however I discovered long after playing it how much content can be skipped while doing the Honeybee Inn segment if you don't know what you are doing. I rememebr leaving Midgar and I think I got to Rocket Town and thatw as it. But even that was hazy. I spent a lot of time and money on Fort Condor and having NEVER encountered Yuffie. Needless to say I was waiting to see how this would either soar or flop on that hype alone.

#### Objectives

Spanning three discs, Final Fantasy is not a short game. There is a main plot and as the game opens up, there are a number of side-quests as well. Some are for small things like end game equipment in a location only reaccessible at the end of the game. Some are the obvious side-quest for a characters' final Limit Break or ultimate weapon. And others are just mini games. Because if there is something Final Fantasy VII is chock full of, it is mini games.
Our plan is to complete all the side quests needed for ultimate Limit Breaks and weapons. As there are no special dungeons, we won't need to worry about those.

Superbosses are a point of contention with me. Anyone who had read these understands this. Especially post-game super bosses that offer no extra plot. Luckilly, Final Fantasy VII features the infamous Weapons—biological weapons of war unleashed by the planet to defend it from harm. Specifically we have a chance at fighting the Ultimate, Ruby and Emerald Weapons. Which we fought all of as they didn't require too much. Ultimate Weapon gives us Cloud's Ultima Weapon. Ruby and Emerald drop items we can trade in for Master Materia—fancy Materia that provides access to all Magic, all Summons or all Commands in a single conventient slot. A must have for the one-winged angel slayer in training. I will take a moment to point out that while streaming this, my audience expected me to be frustrated with these battles, and I 100% absolutely ahnihillated both of these superbosses without breaking a sweat.

#### Review

Final Fantasy VII is a game. I won't put ti down so far as I did Final Fantasy IV, but wow does it not live up to the hype it has. It truly does not. The first portion of the game in Midgar is interesting. It has a fascinating plot, and motivations for characters make sense. Once we leave Midgar, the rest of the game falls flat by compariosn. Which is a real shame since Midgar is only about eight or nine hours of gameplay. When we leave, we have almost the entire party with us. This however does not lead to as much growth and development as you'd think having the entire party there for plot points. Instead the party is just there. When they signed up, they were all deep and 

Final Fantasy VI is phenomenal in a multitude of ways. The number of options for how your final party can come together adds replayability. The individual characters are unique and their stories are interesting. You grow to care about almost everyone in your party. Some of my favorite moments are when you have to simultaneously use multiple parties. Something I would have loved more of. But Final Fantasy VI's biggest asset is ambition. They did try to go all out with this game, but it also seems that ambition is its biggest flaw.

Similar to previous installments, we start the game with all these unique characters. And like before, that individuality slips as the game progresses. The mid-game leaves us focused on the affairs of the world around us. We get a resurgence in the second half of the game as the individual side-quests come along. The problem is that you can skip out on a lot of them and still be fine. Not to mention three characters—Mog, Gogo, and Umaro—have little development. They could be completely removed from the game and nothing would be affected.

The biggest flaw for Final Fantasy VI has to be in its ending. You have this amazingly built-up story, with a dramatic final battle. The curtains close and we have an escape scene with details about the characters. We see their fates for the most part after the battle. It all ends up feeling anti-climactic. We saved the world, but we don't get to see what that means. We don't get a single glimpse of the world springing new life. Up to now, every game has ended with us knowing the party was safe, and the world is flourishing. The world of Final Fantasy VI has gone through a lot, and it would have been nice to get more information about it.

#### Final Thoughts

I love Final Fantasy V, it is 100% my favorite in the series. But with that said, Final Fantasy VI is a phenomenal game. It looks amazing. The story is bigger than everything before this. The soundtrack does not disappoint. Overall, it holds up well even to modern games. Of all the games worthy of a replay, this is one of them. I would happily play it again and who knows, maybe I'll do some post-game content.
