This blog was written using [Visual Studio Code][vscode], and is compiled with the help of [jekyll][jekyll-org]. The layout is a modified version of [Minimalist][minimalist] by Marc Weitz. The color scheme is currently based on the voidlingBento design documents and features the colors <span class="invert">**Crow**</span>, <span class="glow">**Black Cat**</span> and **Snowshoe Hare**. The typography features a courier-style font called [Special Elite][font], which is available through Google Fonts under the [Open Fonts Licence][font-ofl], as well as some light use of [Font Awesome][awesome] glyphs.
