## Authors
We are the Dumpling system (she/they), better known collectively as voidlingBento, the internet's favorite steamer basket. We are queer content creators sharing a body. The members of the system are **White Rabbit** (*aka rabbitDumpling*), **Black Cat** (aka *kittyGyoza*) and **Broken Muse** (aka *corvidRangoon*). We enjoy tabletop RPGs, writing, and streaming video games. When not working on a mariad of projects we are usually streaming! That's right, we are also Twitch Affiliates and can often be found streaming with any of our very wonderful partners.
