[![Final Fantasy (in)Complete]({{site.images}}/project/ffc.png)](/projects/ffc/){: .align-center}
An ongoing stream project from 2020, <span class="rabbit">rabbit</span> set out to challenge the first ten mainline Final Fantasy games. When she announced this, someone asked if she was going to 100% finish each game, to which our collective answer was a resounding "No." Since starting this project, the scope has expanded, and you can read about that entire saga here.

[![Backlog Report]({{site.images}}/project/backlog-report.png)](/projects/backlog/){: .align-center}
To say we own more than a few games would be putting it lightly. Our collection has continued growing over the years, and so we use [The Backloggery](https://backloggery.com/voidlingBento) to organize that collection. And while we do stream quite a bit, we try to play some games on our own if qw don't think they would stream well. So while qw get through my backlog of games (both online and offline), qw plan on writing reviews for the games that stand out. Join us as we do battle with the minions of Bak'laag! ![Bak'laag]({{site.images}}/backlog/baklaag.png){: .align-right}

<!-- ### [Final Battle](/final_battle/){: .align-center}
A gunslinger, a psychic elf, a pyromancer high schooler, and a space baker walk into a pub. Their goal is to get the latest gossip and earn some money: this is Final Battle. A universal system to allow characters from different universes to come together. Final Battle is by far my largest RPG project. -->
