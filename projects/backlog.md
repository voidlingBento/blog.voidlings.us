To say we own more than a few games would be putting it lightly. Our collection has continued growing over the years, and so we use [The Backloggery](https://backloggery.com/voidlingBento) to organize that collection. And while we do stream quite a bit, we try to play some games on our own if qw don't think they would stream well. So while qw get through my backlog of games (both online and offline), qw plan on writing reviews for the games that stand out. Join us as we do battle with the minions of Bak'laag! ![Bak'laag]({{site.images}}/backlog/baklaag.png){: .align-right}
