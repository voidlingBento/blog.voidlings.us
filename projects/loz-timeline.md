Live on DumplingTV, Sorcha and I are playing through the official Zelda Timeline (with some edits). Do you want to name a Link on the Timeline? You can donate a cup of tea over at our [Ko-Fi Page](https://ko-fi.com/rabbitdumpling). Pick your favorite Zelda itle and suggest a name in your donation comment! All proceeds are going to recoup whatever costs are incurred during this fun little project!
